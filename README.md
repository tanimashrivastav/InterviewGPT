# InterviewGPT

InterviewGPT is an AI-powered interview preparation workspace designed to help you turn your background into clear, role-aligned answers and focused practice.

It helps you:
- extract strong “story inventory” from your experience
- generate STAR/behavioral responses that sound specific (not generic)
- practice with mock interviews and role-targeted question sets
- tighten your resume/LinkedIn narrative so it matches how you interview

> Goal: make your answers sharper, more structured, and more consistent—without sounding rehearsed.

## What InterviewGPT does

### 1) Story inventory (your personal answer bank)
- Identifies projects, leadership moments, conflict/ambiguity examples, and impact metrics
- Builds reusable “story cards” you can adapt across roles

### 2) STAR answer generation + refinement
- Creates STAR responses that emphasize ownership, tradeoffs, and measurable outcomes
- Rewrites for tone (concise, confident, technical, executive-friendly)
- Flags fluff, vagueness, and missing metrics

### 3) Mock interviews
- Behavioral: communication, conflict, prioritization, leadership, failures
- Technical: role-appropriate depth (system design, APIs, debugging, etc.)
- Follow-ups: pushes deeper like a real interviewer

### 4) Role-targeted question banks
- Generates question sets based on role type and seniority
- Includes “signals” interviewers look for + what a strong answer contains

### 5) Feedback and practice loops
- Scores answers on clarity, specificity, structure, and impact
- Suggests edits and alternative phrasing
- Tracks weak areas to practice next

## How it works (conceptually)

1. You provide context (resume bullets, role description, projects, constraints).
2. InterviewGPT turns that into a structured story bank.
3. You practice via mock interviews and curated question sets.
4. You iterate using feedback until answers are crisp and repeatable.

## Getting started

You can use this repo in whichever way fits your workflow:
- Start by collecting your experience and key projects into a “story inventory”
- Add a target role/job description and generate a practice plan
- Run mock sessions and refine answers until they’re consistent

Recommended first outputs:
- 8–12 story cards (impact-heavy)
- STAR answers for: conflict, failure, leadership, ambiguity, prioritization
- A 30–45 minute mock interview script

---

## Suggested content organization

Depending on what’s included here, you may see materials like:
- `docs/` – design notes, planning, rubrics, and guidelines
- `prompts/` – interview prompt templates and scoring checklists
- `examples/` – sample story cards and STAR answers
- `notes/` – learnings, iteration history, and next steps

(If your repo structure differs, rename these sections to match.)

## Quality bar (what “good” looks like)

A strong answer:
- starts with a 1–2 sentence setup
- names constraints and tradeoffs
- shows what *you* did (not “we”)
- includes metrics or concrete outcomes
- ends with a lesson learned or improvement

Avoid:
- vague claims (“improved performance a lot”)
- long context dumps
- jargon without decisions/outcomes
- answers that don’t match the role

---

## Privacy and data

If you include personal materials (resume drafts, job descriptions, notes):
- remove or anonymize sensitive identifiers where possible
- treat this repo like a workspace that may be shared
- store only what you’d be comfortable showing a recruiter/interviewer

---

## Roadmap ideas

- Structured scoring rubric per role (SWE/PM/DS)
- “Interview day pack” generator (top stories + cheatsheets)
- Company-specific question packs and values mapping
- Practice analytics (weak areas → targeted drills)
